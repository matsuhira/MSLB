Abstract

   This document specifies Multi-Stage Transparent Server Load Balancing
   (MSLB) specification.  MSLB make server load balancing over Layer3
   network without packet header change at client and server.  MSLB make
   server load balancing with any protocol and protocol with encription
   such as IPsec ESP, SSL/TLS.

1.  Introduction

   This document specifies Multi-Stage Transparent Server Load Balancing
   (MSLB) specification.

   MSLB provide server load balancing function over Layer3 network
   without packet header change at client and server.  MSLB work with
   any protocol and protocol with payload encription such as IPsec ESP,
   SSL/TLS.

2.  Traditional load balancing method

   There are several load balancing technique, such as round robin DNS,
   IP Anycasting [RFC1546] and destination address translation.
   Figure 1 shows load balancing system with typical server load
   balancer with destination address translation technique.

   It is well-known that Network address translator break internet
   transparency [RFC2775] and have a application dependency [RFC2993]
   characteristic.

   Some server load balancer use application data, so with IPsec ESP,
   SSL/TLS, this mechanisms may not work well.


3.  Architecture of MSLB


   Load balancing is the tecnique that distribute packet to multiple
   server.  For packet distribution, destination addresss translation
   technique is useful, however this technique itself break internet
   transparency.

   After distribution, if write back to the original destination address
   may possoble, it is possible to recover transparency.  This is the
   basic idea and architecture of MSLB.  Figure 2 shows architecture of
   MSLB.


     Client ----  overwrite    +----------  write back  ----- server
                  destination  |
                  address      + ---------  write back  ----- server
                               |
                               :                 :              :

                               + ---------  write back  ----- server

   This method process only destination address of IP header.  This
   method can be applied to both IPv4 and IPv6.

   MSLB-F is front function of MSLB and translate destination address to
   one of the address of MSLB-B.  BSLB-B s backend function of MSLB and
   translate destination address to the original server address, i.e.
   address of MSLB-F.  The IP address of MSLB-F and all server is the
   same value.

   This configuration, MSLB-F is connecting to the network with single
   link, that is one arm configuration.  This case, retuen packet, i.e.
   packet from server to client does not pass through the MSLB-F.


5.  mode


   MSLB have two mode, one is address translation mode, and the other is
   encapsulation mode.


5.1.  address translation mode


   This mode using address translation technique.

   Figure Figure 6 shows packet processing with address translation
   mode.

   In this figure, to the Client, IP address is allocated IP_C1, IP_C2,
   and server IP address is IP_S.  This case, IP_S is also allocate to
   all servers and MSLB-F.  And to the MSLB-B, IP_B1, IP_B2, IP_B3 is
   allocated.  These allocation is shown in upper part of Figure 6.

   Lower part of Figure 6 shows packet transfered between client and
   server.  From Client to the Server, only destination address is
   translate, MSLB-F translate from IP_S to IP_B1, and MSLB-B translate
   from IP_B1 to IP_S.  Then the destination address of packet which
   send client and the destination address of packet which recieve
   server is same address.  That mean, transparency is remained.


   Return packet, i.e., from server to the client is not translate, just
   forwarded.

   In the Internet, Client IP address and server IP address must Global
   IP address, however, IP address of MSLB-B may private IP address.

   Figure 7 shows MSLB table.  MSLB have this table and translate the
   destination address using this table value.  MSLB-F check source IP
   address, and translate destination address with this table.


   Using IPv4-IPv6 translation may possible, i.e., IPv4 packet
   translated to IPv6, then translate to IPv4 or IPv6 packet translate
   to IPv4, then translate IPv6 may possibleFigure 8 shows possible
   combination of IPv4 and IPv6.  These IPv4-IPv6 translation case will
   be defined in future.

   In this figure, to the Client, IP address is allocated IP_C1, IP_C2,
   and server IP address is IP_S.  This case, IP_S is also allocate to
   all servers and MSLB-F.  And to the MSLB-B, IP_B1, IP_B2, IP_B3 is
   allocated.  These allocation is shown in upper part of Figure 6.

   Lower part of Figure 6 shows packet transfered between client and
   server.  From Client to the Server, MSLB-F encapsulate original IP
   packet and send to MSLB-B.  MSLB-B decapsulate outer IP header, and
   forwarad to the server.  Inner IP packet does not change, that mean,
   transparency is remained.

   With encapsulation mode, packet size is increase, so fragmentation is
   needed if encapsulated packet size exceed MTU or Path MTU.  MSLB-F
   MUST support tunnel MTU discovery [RFC1853].  Fragmentation and Path
   MTU discovery [RFC1191] issue will describe in future.


   Return packet, i.e., from server to the client is not encapsulate,
   just forwarded.

   In the Internet, Client IP address and server IP address must Global
   IP address, however, IP address of MSLB-B may private IP address.

   Figure 10 shows MSLB table.  MSLB have this table and encapsulate and
   generate outer header with destination address using this table
   value.  MSLB-F check source IP address, and generate destination
   address of outer header with this table.

   Using IPv4 over IPv6 encapsulation or IPv6 over IPv4 encapsulation

   decapsulate to IPv4 or IPv6 packet encapsulated to IPv4, then
   deencapsulated IPv6 may possibleFigure 11 shows possible combination
   of IPv4 and IPv6.  These IPv4-IPv6 encapsulation case will be defined

6.  Ingress filtering environment


   [RFC2827] describe ingress filtering for defending DoS attack which
   employ IP source address spoofing.

   Depend on the location of the MSLB-F and MSLB-B, it is possible that
   packet from server to client is discarded by ingress filtering.  In
   such case, encapsulating the packet from server to client might
   resolve.  Figure 12 shows such solution.
